What if you want to use a Service Account that doesn’t require interaction with user & browser? For example, if you want to access Google Analytics programmatically?

Well, what you’ll need to use is the JWT (JSON Web Token) method. Doing it this way wasn’t well documented, so I want to share how it’s done. I figured out how to do this through googleapis module’s test code. This is also another reason why I want people to write tests.

First, you should have gotten a .p12 file and a secret to decrypt the file when you created the service account in Google API console. Run the following command to decrypt the p12 file.

openssl pkcs12 -in googleapi-privatekey.p12 -out googleapi-privatekey.pem -nocerts -nodes
